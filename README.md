## Reflection
#### Design
1. The class diagram was the most helpful. A lot of the bot was based off of classes and their methods. Having a diagram helped the team be able to completly understand how the classes would be designed and imteract with each other.
2. The most difficult was coming up with the scope of the project. A finance bot could take a bunch of different directions. From being more cryptocurrency based, to more stock based, to more budget based. We should have defined a clearer scope sooner. Our scope was too big origionally and we did not get to a lot of what we first wanted to do.
3. The class diagram worked really well here and I would definitely use it again.
#### Implementation
1. Staying close to the diagrams we made in the design milestone was the most helpful. It helped the entire team stay consistent with our code.
2. The most difficult was mostly testing. I should have began testing the bot much sooner. A lot of the bugs near the end of the project could have been avoided by testing earlier. Unit tests were the best way to test this project.
3. Unit tests were very helpful here and I will definitely use them again.
#### Process
1. The kanban board was helpful with splitting up tasks evenly and keeping track of everyone's progress.
2. The most difficult was creating issues that weren't vague. If someone made an issue that wasn't specific, the person fixing the issue sometimes misunderstood what the project needed.
3. I will use the Kanban board again.
#### Overall
Creating different diagrams in combination with the Kanban board seemed to be a very effective and efficient way to develop. First, the diagrams like storyboard and class diagrams, helped the entire team understand how the project would look and work. This allowed us to spend more time individually developing rather than having to wait in a group to develop. Next, the Kanban board allowed us to split up the user stories in a fair way. It also allowed us to see how everyone is doing on progress. 
If we saw that one person was lagging behind on their story, we would check in and help them with their issues. In previos projects, we have just split up the work and each group member just made their own sections. With this strategy, there was no cohesion for the site. With pre-development planning, there was much more cohesion throughout each user story and the entire website.
