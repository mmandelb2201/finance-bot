### Iteration 1: Mar 28 - Apr 10


#### Matt

###### Completed Tasks - Completed making basic objects such as the user, transaction, and bank account.

###### Incomplete tasks - Started making the suggestion bots for account suggestions, retirement suggestions, and spending suggestions.

###### Process Reflection - A couple of things helped making the objects simpler. First, was making detailed documentation before we started developing. Since finances can be extremely complicated, we needed to do things in a specific way to make development easier. Therefore, many document were made detailing how the objects would be made and how they would be used. This allowed for good, consistent development. Also, documenting specifically what the bot would look for about the user was extremely helpful. For example, we would look to see if the user spent more than 30% of their income to wants, to which we had recomendations lined up to give the user if that was the case. Overall, this iteration showed the importance of detailed diagrams and documentation.
