## Documentation on story creation and assignment at EACH iteration (one option is to include screenshots of kanban board).

## Any scrum meeting notes.

## Include documentation of EACH iteration end. Include status of completed and incomplete tasks, and a process reflection.


### Iteration 1: Mar 28 - Apr 10


#### Matt

###### Completed Tasks - Completed making basic objects such as the user, transaction, and bank account.

###### Incomplete tasks - Started making the suggestion bots for account suggestions, retirement suggestions, and spending suggestions.

###### Process Reflection - A couple of things helped making the objects simpler. First, was making detailed documentation before we started developing. Since finances can be extremely complicated, we needed to do things in a specific way to make development easier. Therefore, many document were made detailing how the objects would be made and how they would be used. This allowed for good, consistent development. Also, documenting specifically what the bot would look for about the user was extremely helpful. For example, we would look to see if the user spent more than 30% of their income to wants, to which we had recomendations lined up to give the user if that was the case. Overall, this iteration showed the importance of detailed diagrams and documentation.

### Iteration 2: Apr 11 - Apr 24


#### Matt

###### Completed Tasks - Completed suggestion generators and the bot as a whole. The bot now effectively takes a look at user financial data and returns suggestions on how they can improve.

###### Incomplete tasks - There are a couple of bugs in the bot and a couple of non-core functions that do not work as intended as of right now. Some of the website styling needs to be updated.

###### Process Reflection - The big lesson I took away from this is the importance of testing as you are developing. Near the end of the iteration, much of the time was spent testing the bot. A lot of the bugs should have been fixed sooner. They problably would have been fixed sooner if we had been testing sooner. Because of this, unnecesarry stuff about the website such as styling and remote database functionality were put on the backburner. Other than that, the documentation again was very userful for consitent, clear development between the entire team.
